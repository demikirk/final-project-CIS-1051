# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Sims 4 Biochemist Career Track



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Sims 4 mod that adds the career track of Biochemist.



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I am creating a custom sims 4 career mod that simulates the journey of working in the field of biochemistry. This mod will have a new career path that allows Sims to start as undergrads and gradually work their way up to full on biochemists. The career will be divided into several levels, each with unique job titles, salaries, daily tasks, and moods. The mod will be written in Python and I will maybe use Sims 4 Studio to integrate it into the actual game. and the functions will control the "go to work" logic, introducing randomized outcomes such as experiment success, equipment failure, or lab disasters. Each outcome will affect a Sim’s performance and can trigger custom buffs to alter the Sim’s emotional state. A dictionary will store the job levels, associated tasks, and salaries, and conditional statements will manage promotions and job related events.



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome will be to at least get the career track up in running in the actual game which would be the baseline. The other additions like "randomized outcomes such as experiment success, equipment failure, or lab disasters" would take more work to integrate.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would consists of being able to successfully integrate some of the additions that I mentioned previously. I am not too familiar with what goes into adding all of the extras on and the level of expertise it takes to actually have them work properly in game.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possible outcome would to have the fully functional career in the Sims 4, with all of the additions I listed above. I know that the Sims 4 can be kind of buggy so having the mod word seamlessly would be ideal.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For my next steps, I’m planning to dive deeper into how classes work in Python so I can build a clear system to track career levels, tasks, and performance. I’ll need to brush up on using the random module to simulate unpredictable events (like lab disasters, etc.) and probably learn how to incorporate XML files as I know a lot of mods for the Sims 4 use that.  I’ll also spend time figuring out the best way to display feedback — like print statements or logs that show career progress and outcomes.
